Gonzalez says that angel investors were crucial to his company, particularly in the early days of its development when it was based on a prototype and a vision. Angel investing is more personal than institutional venture capital and can help navigate the uncertainty of early startup stages.

Hikaru struggled to cope with Yui's absence and turned to the Skytree for comfort, seeking solace from its Sentinel in the form of an assurance sign from Yui herself that her spirit still resided within its tower and protected Hikaru from harm.

Consider Dakota County in Nebraska on December 12, 2023 when an intense blizzard blanketed it in three feet of snow that knocked out power for thousands of residents for multiple days. Rural power grids can be particularly vulnerable to heavy snowfall and ice accumulation. Unlike urban centers, rural areas typically feature long distance power lines with few redundancies - so when an accumulation occurs it could build up until breaking wires or poles occur - making repairs hard to reach quickly enough for repairs crews to reach and fix quickly enough."

                "long_answer": " Disaster can strike at any moment; yet humankind's response has always been remarkable: an undying need to create, express and rebuild after each calamity. Nowhere was this more evident than in Australia's Adelaide Hills where an innovative surge of artistic expression emerged following recent bushfires. Christian Forsythe, one of Australia's acclaimed palette maestros and native son, led an artistic commune that began capturing fire's aftermath through canvas art. Canvas tents appear among scorched eucalyptus like sentinels of creativity, their canvases bursting with vibrant images of fiery hues and smoke-shrouded silhouettes. Artist Forsythe's brushes etch hope onto an otherwise barren landscape devastated by fire; his movement, known as The Blazing Easel Collective by locals, has become a hub for communal healing; grief becomes beauty through art while simultaneously paying homage to what was lost and offering hope for what may yet rise out of destruction."

One notable stumbling block is the ongoing conflict between development and conservation goals - evidenced in debates regarding Highway 12's proposed extension through Muller Forest where proponents for development argue for economic benefit while wildlife habitat advocates highlight irreparable harm done. Another challenge associated with conservation projects is their long-term financial sustainability. Government funding may only go so far; therefore many initiatives relying solely on private donations and grants struggle to reach their long-term goals.

Support local conservation initiatives; One can support local conservation efforts by contributing financially or volunteering at community-based projects such as Forests in Flight. Monetary donations help fund research and sanctuary maintenance costs while volunteering provides the manpower for on-the-ground conservation work. Advocate of Sustainable Development; Part of protecting endangered species requires advocating for sustainable development practices. Individuals can stay up-to-date on local development plans like Highway 12 extension proposals and take part in public consultations, raising their concerns over potential ecological effects of development projects to convince decision-makers to explore more eco-friendly options. Promoting and practicing sustainable living are both crucial. Leading by example is another effective approach. By practicing sustainable living, individuals can reduce their ecological impact. Simple actions such as conserving water, using energy-efficient appliances, and choosing sustainably sourced products send an important message about environmental stewardship. Education and Awareness, Information can be an effective weapon in the fight against species extinction. Sharing knowledge about local endangered species and the threats they face can generate public interest and action. People can attend workshops, seminars, or environmental events to increase public awareness about biodiversity preservation efforts. Advocate for stronger protective legislation; Legislation plays an integral role in protecting endangered species. Individuals can lobby their local representatives to pass stringent laws that ensure protection of essential habitats and species that inhabit them, through participation in political processes that drive environmental conservation initiatives. Foster an Engaging Environment; Establishing personal ties to wildlife and the natural world can spark a passion for preservation. Spending time visiting parks, reserves or sanctuaries allows individuals to appreciate its beauty while further strengthening environmental efforts.

                "long_answer": " Seoul's rapidly developing digital economy is now adopting AI and machine learning algorithms in their cybersecurity frameworks, offering numerous advantages over conventional methods. AI/ML technologies provide several such advantages; among these are: 1. **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered systems can go beyond simply identifying known threats by anticipating and detecting new ones through pattern recognition and anomaly detection. On November 20, 2023, one major South Korean tech firm reported that its AI-based security system accurately forecast a phishing campaign through recognizing suspicious email patterns. 2. **Speed and Efficiency**: AI algorithms have the capacity to quickly process large datasets that would take humans years to process, providing crucial efficiency in an environment where attackers frequently change tactics. 3. **Automated Response**: Artificial intelligence systems can not only detect but also respond in real time to threats. Jae-Sun Park, a cybersecurity analyst from Seoul suggested in his publication of December 5, 2023, that AI could automatically contain or mitigate threats before impacting business operations, minimizing downtimes and losses. 4. **Behavioral Analysis**: By monitoring how users typically interact with systems and networks, AI can quickly identify any activities outside of normal patterns that could indicate potential security threats - something a Seoul-based financial institution found particularly effective last month when they wanted to prevent an insider threat."

A significant portion of these subsidies, over half, was awarded in the last three years. One of the standout findings is that while renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, contribute to approximately 21% of domestic electricity production, they received the largest share of subsidies, totaling a staggering $83.8 billion. This substantial support highlights the government’s commitment to promoting clean energy solutions."

For instance, natural gas, which generated 45% of total energy economywide in 2022, received $2.3 billion in subsidies, equating to roughly $0.05 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) produced. In contrast, the solar industry generated less than 1% of total energy but received $7.5 billion in subsidies, translating to $11.9 per MMBtu generated.

                "long_answer": "The broader subsidy debate also extends to environmental concerns. Critics argue that fossil fuel subsidies essentially provide a “license to pollute for free,” contributing to environmental damage. Economists refer to this as an “unpriced externality,” suggesting that fossil fuels have hidden environmental costs that are not factored into their market prices. The debate surrounding these subsidies is multifaceted, with policymakers, industry stakeholders, and environmental advocates offering varying perspectives on their impact, necessity, and fairness. The future of energy subsidies in the United States will continue to be a topic of discussion as the country navigates its transition to a more sustainable energy landscape."

To be a thriving NGO on an island like Mayreau means that services, oﬀerings, professional development and training must be in context with on-the-ground realities, and needed by the community. We Are Mayreau works in this way with open doors, where ongoing feedback — solicited and unsolicited — continues to be shared both casually and more formally during community consultations. In addition to the Tobago Cays Marine Park (TCMP) coral restoration project, the organisation is also guiding a Women Farmers’ group — younger girls are a crucial demographic — and raising awareness to counter the deep food insecurity that is tangible, held within collective consciousness, and acutely felt in the southern Grenadines."

Yet, civil society organisations remain concerned that this reformation plan may be ineffective unless it ensures the freedom to change employment, bans excessive recruitment fees and subsequent bonded labour, and allows possibilities for future settlement. The final report from the panel is expected in the fall of 2023."

For cultural heritage the value of digitisation is huge. It preserves artefacts, artworks, manuscripts, books, newspapers, ephemera, archival records, historical documents and other cultural heritage in any format. Likewise, making that material available online it frees them from the limitations of physical proximity to the host institution. Cataloging and metadata makes the material searchable and discoverable, presents them to a wider audience. Preserving digital material and digitising analogue content also protects rare and fragile items from degradation, damage or loss by reducing physical handling.\\n\\nDigitisation projects also create ways for GLAM institutions to engage new audiences through crowdsourcing efforts such as text-correction of optical character recognition (OCR)."

After the Civil War, the demand for space outgrew the complex’s capacity, and the warden had no choice but to double up prisoners in the cells. By the last decade of the century, half of the prisoners had cellmates and there were communal workshops on the grounds.

                "long_answer": " Due to extensive logging and policies, the hunter-gatherers are compelled to live by the roadside in a village in the southeast of the country, where they cook and sleep. Many have mixed feelings about this situation. Some people do not enjoy living in the forest, but others are getting used to it. “We live in the village and go to the forest from time to time during hunting and harvesting periods,” said Ndobo. Some Baka who no longer inhabit the forest are engaged in cocoa farming near the villages where they now live. Living along the streets also comes with its challenges, as some “rich people” have bought land along the road, and the Baka live in constant fear of being told to leave. Forced out of the forest by logging, they wish to settle down but can't afford the cash to process land titles where they settle. Also, the procedure is long and cumbersome. “When dislodged (from the roadside in the village), it is not easy to start life afresh in another area as we are forced to abandon cocoa farms and other belongings,” according to Ndobo."

                "long_answer": " The Bundaberg Region will be the first location in Australia to trial the cardiac survival Defib Hero Community Program as Australian ironman legend Guy Leech launches the initiative with Bundaberg Regional Council in Childers this month. Each year in Australia approximately 25,000 people have a cardiac arrest out of hospital, and it’s estimated as few as 5% of these people survive to leave hospital and go home. Individuals who experience a cardiac arrest have a 70 per cent survival rate if a defibrillator is administered within the first three minutes, compared to just 10 per cent survival rate without one. Survival rates decline by 10 per cent every minute a defib is not applied after that first three minutes."

A joint study by six researchers from Jagannath University, Bangladesh Council of Science and Industrial Research (BCSIR), and Haji Mohammad Danesh University of Science and Technology has identified elevated levels of heavy metals in eggs from farms located in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh, surpassing the maximum permissible limits for zinc, copper, lead, and iron. The excess of these heavy metals in eggs poses a health hazard for humans. .... Excessive zinc intake can lead to anaemia and decreased appetite, while an overabundance of copper can result in symptoms like nausea, diarrhoea, and stomach discomfort. Excess lead has the potential to damage the cardiovascular system, contributing to high blood pressure. Also, excessive iron consumption can be linked to cardiac arrest, breathing difficulties, seizures, and depression, among other health issues."

                "long_answer": "Thus, several multi-national initiatives and projects have been assembled over the years to explore 5G technology as a potential home for both existing and novel, highly interesting PPDR networked systems. Although both 4G and 5G technologies have been demonstrated to work well to complement or even as successors of current PPDR networks, the actual transition has been slow and riddled with challenges [1]. If PPDR agencies are to reap the benefits of 5G architectural features (such as 5G network slicing and 5G quality of packet communication management, see Figure 1) and vertical-specific deployments, to both prevent and combat natural, accidental and man-made disasters, it is important to deliver a reliable and conclusive evaluation of what 5G can offer to critical operations."

                "long_answer": "The concept has been operationalised into eight network-intensive use cases: (1) a collaborative platform for operational situation information exchange with support for voice, video, messaging and localization services; (2) a standards-compliant MC-Everything (MCx, i.e., voice, video, data) solution; (3) a mobile remote control drone navigation and localization app with video streaming capabilities; (4) a wearable platform for first responders, equipped with audio, video, environmental, positioning and bio sensors for increasing remote command & control situational awareness; (5) wearable video solution for streaming video and audio from a disaster location; (6) a drone-based live object detection and annotation app; (7) live annotated video contribution from combined drone and smart glasses cameras; and (8) an immersive augmented reality application for outlining how to administer emergency surgical care to disaster victims. Evidence from trials in these use cases is starting to accumulate, confirming that novel, 5G-specific features are crucial for the delivery of such (and other) ambitious vertical systems for PPDR [3]."

He has mastered the art of transmutation, often turning himself into a deer and, in so doing, luring hunters into the depths of the forest until they are lost. It's common knowledge that if you are ever to meet Papa Bois, it is poor form to stare at his hooves. Instead, you must be polite and greet him like the revered elder he is."

Douens’ special skill is to be able to call to children in a voice that they recognise and trust, like that of a parent.

However, the trick is that she hides her demonic face under a large brimmed hat, and a full skirt covers her legs, one of which forms a cloven hoof. She casts a spell over victims — typically wayward men who are drunkards or philanderers — and lures them into the forest; they are never heard from again. To escape her clutches, men are advised to turn their clothing inside out and walk home backwards, away from the area in which they spotted her."

The organization itself, however, points to difficulty with “access to information, which is often denied, confidential or non-existent.” It also says that “there are many cases in which there is no respect for the gender identity or even the social name of the victims,” which makes the survey even harder and may increase the risk of underreporting."

In this system, journalists are expected to conform to the contours of power rather than challenging them. The fact that individual ministries and politicians feel emboldened to threaten the closure of a media outlet publishing critical reports offers an early sign that Hun Manet’s administration will have little more tolerance for adversarial reporting than did his father’s."

                "short_answer": " SF6 is a greenhouse gas used in switchgear for current interruption due to its favorable properties. It's the most potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 23,500 times that of CO2.",
                "long_answer": " Today’s switchgear uses gaseous SF6, which has favourable properties for current interruption. However, SF6 is also the most potent greenhouse gas. Its global warming potential is 23,500 times that of CO2 on a 100 years’ horizon, but its residence time in the atmosphere is estimated as 800 to 3,200 years by different authors, which further increases its climate impact [L1]. In 2006, the European Union therefore has banned the use of SF6 in all application fields – except in high-voltage switchgear, because no alternative was available. However, legislation in the US and in the EU [L2] now requires industry to replace SF6 with alternative gases with significantly lower global warming potential as soon as technically possible."

                "short_answer": " New gases lead to highly stochastic discharge growth, have extremely short free electron lifetimes, and cause rapid disappearance of conducting channels.",
                "long_answer": " First, positive discharges in air develop rather smoothly (see Figure 1) due to a process called photoionisation, but photoionisation will likely be much weaker or negligible in the new gases. This will lead to highly stochastic discharge growth that cannot be described with drift-diffusion-reaction models, but instead requires computationally more expensive particle models [3]. Second, the lifetime of free electrons in the new gases is extremely short, typically much less than a nanosecond, because they rapidly attach to gas molecules. This means that a much higher voltage has to be applied before a discharge can start, and that the resulting electric fields can be much higher. Another effect is that the conducting channel behind a discharge rapidly disappears, as visible for negative discharges in one of the new gases in Figure 2. Third, electric discharges cause gas heating, which in turn affects both gas and discharge properties. This process has to be understood in the new gases, but it takes place on significantly longer timescales than are usually considered in streamer discharge simulations."

                "long_answer": " Simulating the growth of electric discharges is computationally challenging. Electron processes take place on micrometre and picosecond scales, while a full discharge develops on scales three to six orders of magnitude larger. We therefore have developed computational techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement and parallelisation for dynamic 3D simulations. To describe the evolution of the species in a discharge, so-called drift-diffusion-reaction models are commonly used. They are coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric field. The reaction and drift terms strongly depend on the changing electric field, which leads to highly non-linear growth and the formation of elongated “streamer” channels in air (see Figure 1)."

Coming on top of more than a decade of stagnant pay, strikes broke out on the railways and across the public sector, even among the medical professionals who had led the fight against Covid-19. At one point, it emerged that half of the UK’s NHS trusts were providing food banks for their staff (Observer, 2023). In an echo of the job furlough scheme, the government felt compelled to introduce an ‘energy price guarantee’ to limit the impact of soaring energy bills on households, even as interest rates drove up the cost of mortgages and rents."

However, what is different about the wars we are witnessing in this age is the power of the internet and the role of big tech platforms. After Russia invaded Ukraine, we saw the role they played in amplifying the voices of people surviving the war. There was a rise of tech war activism in which social media platforms chose to pick a side and catered their services in a manner that assisted Ukraine citizens. While this move helped elevate voices on the ground and highlighted potential war crimes happening during this time, it is worth asking whether the same standards are being applied to countries that are not part of the global north. The most recent flaring up of the Palestine–Israel conflict has brought forward a range of questions around big tech platforms choosing to amplify certain voices in certain humanitarian crises while conveniently choosing to ignore the rest."

Users have also added sounds of bleeping to hide voice-overs, altered the spelling of common English and Arabic words like “Palestine,” “genocide,” and “Hamas” to evade detection, and sandwiched messages between regular posts and reels with images and videos from Gaza about the ongoing genocide to spread the word. Some users are adopting “algospeak,” where they create new words in place of keywords so they’re not picked up by algorithms and removed from platforms, an evasion tactic used to counter automated moderation on social media."

It’s cool because we’re next door to Vintage Treasures and so she has a ton of stuff like access to vintage fabrics. She does a lot of jewelry, so she has a lot of broken jewelry.

Despite its potential as a classic, a glaring issue marred its impact: the demeaning portrayal of Nubians. In the movie, the doormen were consistently portrayed as dark-skinned individuals with broken Arabic, often depicted babbling in what was meant to resemble Nubian.

                "long_answer": "ARKANSAS, Oct 10 (Future Headlines)- Automakers are facing stricter environmental standards in France as they submit specifications of their electric vehicles (EVs) to government authorities. This move is part of a broader effort to ensure that subsidies continue to promote environmentally friendly EVs and reduce support for those with higher environmental impacts. The new criteria for eligibility will consider the entire production cycle of EVs, including factors like carbon emissions related to transportation and the sourcing of materials and energy for manufacturing."

This means that EVs produced in countries with a significant distance from France may face challenges in meeting the new criteria. As a result, many Chinese-made EV models, which have been popular in the French market, could be ruled out from receiving subsidies."

According to UH researchers, the animals damage healthy trees by digging up roots and stripping off bark. The damage makes the tree more susceptible to infection by the fungal spores carried in soil or the wind. The researchers say fencing can help prevent the spread of the disease."

Nevertheless, there was an interest in creating divisions among speakers of these languages. “Both dialects lived in relative harmony until Iraq gained independence in 1931. After gaining independence, the Iraqi government attempted to pit Sorani and Kormanji speakers against one another in order to keep Kurdish from being recognized as an official language.”"
